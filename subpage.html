<p>I am in the symphonic band and I play the saxophone. </p>

<p> Krypton exploded as a result of a nuclear chain reaction caused by the planet's unstable radioactive core. But before that 
the planet is believed to be inhabited by brilliant minds possessing supernatural powers. </p>
<p> Unfortunately all the civilizations and races of my world perished in the explosion, with one exception: Me who was placed in 
an escape rocket by my father, Jor-El, and sent to the planet Earth, where I grew up to become Clark Kent. </p>
<p> Krypton was shown to have been a planet similar to Earth, only older by eons and possessed of all the beneficial progress that 
implied (though the downside was the hint that Krypton exploded due mainly to old age). </p>
