<h1> Symphonic Band</h1>
<p>I am in the symphonic band and I play the saxophone. </p>

<p> The Symphonic Band consists of players from year 1 to year 6. Usually, the year 1s will have sectional practice but the DSA pupils will go with the seniors for full band sometimes.</p>
<p> During sectional practice, one senior will have to come along with all the non-dsa year 1s to train us as we do not have any coach to teach us.However, the senior will have to skip full band or will not be able to join the rest of the seniors in sectional practice.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning to play the saxophone but my faulty instrument always produce many screeching sounds which is very unbearable.</p>
<p>So far, I have learnt how to play simple songs smoothly and I am very elated about that. I hope to learn new things about how to play the saxophone in the future.</p>
